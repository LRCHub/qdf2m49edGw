And I set stones on your sanctum shrine
Wrote down a few words so I could remember
Remember that it's not your death that hurts the most
It's the sadness that I kept growing between us
Drifting from places where I always felt stuck and in the way
Lost in the winds of summertime departures
And I hate to say, but I told you so
So many times before
We're all set to lose
One way or the other
We're all set to lose
In the end

And I see now
And I hate to say I told you so
So many times before
Oh I see now
And it's not the fights, the fights we had
That kept me away from you

I've been sticking around, as long as I could
I've been sticking around, as long as I could
For you to decline my care, my invitations
The lantern's tired, the fog's still growing
Shadow's howling, shadow's howling
Waiting to take you away from me, to fly away, to fly away with you
And I'm tired, and I hate to say I told you

And I set stones on your sanctum shrine
Wrote down a few words so I could remember
That it's not your death that hurts the most
It's the sadness that I kept growing between us

And I see now
And I hate to say I told you so
So many times before
Oh I see now
And it's not the fights, the fights we had
That kept me away from you

And I see now
And I hate to say I told you so
So many times before
Oh I see now
And it's not the fights, the fights we had
That kept me away from you
